The new Exascale system at ORNL, Summit, will be an OpenPOWER system with NVIDIA GPUs. To provide a better understand of the working of OpenMP 
programs on this novel architecture we look at the most impactful aspects of the programming model. By examining the POWER8 hardware counters while testing the OpenMP 4.0 affinity features implemented in GNU, we hope to measure effects of affinity at scale. Based on this study, we describe the challenges that we faced in quantifying effects of affinity, limitations in the current OpenMP programming model and how some of these may be addressed in OpenMP 5.0 to provide a \textbf{portable} notation to define better data affinity that works across different architectures. We also discuss the different hardware counters offered by the POWER8 system and highlight those which can help users identify bad data locality within their programs.

%We also endeavor to find the optimum OpenMP settings for different application kernels that can yield the best performance.
